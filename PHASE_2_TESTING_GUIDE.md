# 🧪 Phase 2 Testing Guide - PDF RAG Workflow

## 🎯 Quick Start

**Server:** Already running at `http://localhost:3000`  
**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** None (development mode, no auth required)

---

## 📝 Test Scenario 1: Upload a Document

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Navigate to Trainer Dashboard**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click the "Trainer" card

2. **Go to Upload Page**
   - Click "Upload Documents" button
   - You should see the upload form

3. **Prepare a Test Document**
   - Create a simple text file or use an existing PDF
   - Example content for a TXT file:
     ```
     Ancient India - Indus Valley Civilization
     
     The Indus Valley Civilization was one of the world's earliest urban civilizations.
     It flourished around 2500 BCE in the northwestern regions of South Asia.
     
     Key Features:
     - Advanced urban planning with grid-pattern cities
     - Sophisticated drainage systems
     - Standardized weights and measures
     - Undeciphered script
     
     Major Cities:
     - Harappa
     - Mohenjo-daro
     
     The civilization declined around 1900 BCE, possibly due to climate change.
     ```

4. **Upload the Document**
   - Click the upload area or drag and drop your file
   - Fill in the metadata:
     - **Subject:** History
     - **Topic:** Ancient India
     - **Description:** Notes on Indus Valley Civilization
     - **Visibility:** Public - All students can access
   - Click "Upload Document"

5. **Wait for Processing**
   - You'll see a loading spinner
   - Processing time depends on file size:
     - Small TXT (< 1KB): 5-10 seconds
     - Medium PDF (1-5 pages): 15-30 seconds
     - Large PDF (10+ pages): 30-60 seconds

6. **Verify Success**
   - You should see a green success message
   - The form will auto-reset after 3 seconds

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

```
1. File saved to uploads/documents/
2. Text extracted using LangChain
3. Text split into chunks (500 chars, 100 overlap)
4. Embeddings generated with Gemini (768 dimensions)
5. Document metadata stored in 'documents' table
6. Chunks with embeddings stored in 'document_chunks' table
```

### **Check the Console:**

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Network tab:
- You should see a POST request to `/api/documents/upload`
- Status: 200 OK
- Response should include:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "document": {
      "id": 1,
      "fileName": "your-file.txt",
      "fileType": "txt",
      "subject": "History",
      "topic": "Ancient India",
      "chunksCount": 3
    }
  }
  ```

## 💬 Test Scenario 2: Ask Questions (RAG)

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Navigate to Student Dashboard**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click the "Student" card

2. **Open Documents Chat**
   - Click "Browse Documents" button
   - You should see the chat interface

3. **Ask a Question**
   - Type: "What is the Indus Valley Civilization?"
   - Press Enter

4. **Wait for AI Response**
   - You'll see a loading indicator (3 animated dots)
   - Response time: 5-10 seconds

5. **Verify Response**
   - You should see an AI-generated answer
   - The answer should include information from your uploaded document
   - Sources should be listed at the bottom

### **Example Response:**

```
The Indus Valley Civilization was one of the world's earliest urban civilizations 
that flourished around 2500 BCE in the northwestern regions of South Asia. It was 
known for its advanced urban planning with grid-pattern cities, sophisticated 
drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures. The civilization had major 
cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, and it declined around 1900 BCE, possibly 
due to climate change.

📚 Sources:
1. your-file.txt (History - Ancient India)
```

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

```
1. Query: "What is the Indus Valley Civilization?"
2. Query embedding generated with Gemini
3. Cosine similarity calculated for all chunks
4. Top 5 most similar chunks retrieved
5. Context formatted with chunks
6. Prompt sent to Gemini LLM:
   - System: "You are a helpful study assistant..."
   - Context: [Retrieved chunks]
   - Question: "What is the Indus Valley Civilization?"
7. AI response generated
8. Sources extracted and formatted
9. Response sent to frontend
```

### **Check the Console:**

Network tab should show:
- POST request to `/api/documents/search`
- Status: 200 OK
- Response should include:
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "The Indus Valley Civilization was...",
    "sources": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "fileName": "your-file.txt",
        "subject": "History",
        "topic": "Ancient India"
      }
    ],
    "relevantChunks": [
      {
        "content": "The Indus Valley Civilization was one of...",
        "similarity": 0.87,
        "pageNumber": null
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## 🔍 Test Scenario 3: Multiple Questions

### **Try These Questions:**

1. **Specific Information:**
   - "What were the major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization?"
   - Expected: Harappa and Mohenjo-daro

2. **Features:**
   - "What were the key features of the Indus Valley Civilization?"
   - Expected: Urban planning, drainage systems, weights and measures, script

3. **Timeline:**
   - "When did the Indus Valley Civilization flourish?"
   - Expected: Around 2500 BCE

4. **Decline:**
   - "Why did the Indus Valley Civilization decline?"
   - Expected: Possibly due to climate change around 1900 BCE

5. **Out of Context:**
   - "What is quantum physics?"
   - Expected: "I don't have information about that in the study materials"

## 🧪 Test Scenario 4: Access Control

### **Test Public Documents:**

1. Upload a document with visibility "Public"
2. As a student, you should be able to access it
3. Ask questions about it

### **Test Private Documents:**

1. Upload a document with visibility "Private"
2. As a student, you should NOT see it in search results
3. Questions about it should return "No relevant context found"

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Failed to load embedding model"**

**Cause:** Gemini API key not configured or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file has `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Verify the API key is valid
3. Restart the server

### **Issue 2: "No relevant context found"**

**Cause:** Document not yet processed or no accessible documents

**Solution:**
1. Wait a few seconds after upload
2. Check if document was uploaded successfully
3. Verify document visibility is "Public"

### **Issue 3: Upload takes too long**

**Cause:** Large file or slow embedding generation

**Solution:**
1. Use smaller files for testing (< 5 pages)
2. Check internet connection (Gemini API calls)
3. Check server logs for errors

### **Issue 4: "Cannot read properties of undefined"**

**Cause:** Model provider not initialized

**Solution:**
1. Check if Gemini provider is configured
2. Restart the server
3. Check server logs for provider initialization errors

- "Generated X embeddings"
- "Document inserted with ID: X"
- "Inserted X chunks into database"
```

### **Check Database:**
```bash
# Run the verification script
npx tsx scripts/verify-database.ts

# Should show:
- documents table has entries
- document_chunks table has entries
```

### **Check Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Open DevTools (F12) > Console
// Look for:
- "Upload successful: ..."
- Network requests to /api/documents/*
- Any error messages
```
