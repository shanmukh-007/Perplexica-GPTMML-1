Phase 2 - PDF RAG Implementation

Phase 2 of the Exam Prep Platform focuses on implementing the complete PDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow.

Key Tasks:
1. Document Upload - Trainers can upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
2. Text Extraction - Automatic text extraction using LangChain loaders
3. Document Chunking - Split text into 500-character chunks with 100-character overlap
4. Embedding Generation - Generate vector embeddings using Google Gemini
5. Vector Search - Implement cosine similarity search for relevant chunks
6. RAG-based Q&A - Students can ask questions and get AI-powered answers
7. Source Citations - Display source documents with answers

Technical Implementation:
- Uses Google Gemini for embeddings (text-embedding-004 model)
- Uses Google Gemini for chat responses (gemini-2.0-flash-exp model)
- Stores embeddings in PostgreSQL as JSONB arrays
- Implements access control based on document visibility settings

The system allows trainers to upload study materials and students to ask questions about those materials, with AI providing contextual answers based on the uploaded documents.
