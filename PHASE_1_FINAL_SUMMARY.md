## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Chat Interface Architecture:**

```typescript
// Mode-based routing
/student/chat?mode=documents  → Document Q&A
/student/chat?mode=mcq        → MCQ Practice
/student/chat?mode=mindmap    → Mind Map Generation
/student/chat?mode=websearch  → Web Search

// Component structure
StudentChatWindow
├── Header (mode-specific icon & title)
├── Messages Area (scrollable chat history)
├── Loading Indicator (typing animation)
└── Input Area (textarea + send button)
```

### **Message Flow:**

1. User types query
2. Message added to chat history
3. Loading indicator shown
4. Simulated AI response (Phase 2+ will use real APIs)
5. Response displayed in chat
6. Scroll to bottom

### **Styling:**

- **User messages:** Colored bubbles (mode-specific colors)
- **Assistant messages:** White/dark bubbles with shadow
- **Timestamps:** Displayed for each message
